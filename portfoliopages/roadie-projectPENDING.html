				<h4>User-Centered Design Process and App Conceptualization</h4>
				<div class="info textsection">

					<p>In my Introduction to User-Centered Design class in autumn quarter, we were assigned teams and given the freedom to choose a particular user group to design for. We were led through a 10-week user-focused process that resulted in a high-fidelity prototype.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Our concept focuses on serious hobbyist musicians who want better sound control over their performances because our research showed that inconsistencies in sound balance led to decreased confidence. The resulting project is a hypothetical solution that relies on future technologies such as digital mixing consoles.</p>

					<h1>RESEARCH AND PERSONAS</h1>	
						<img src="../images/roadie-project/joeypersona.png" style="width:60%">
						<p>Each member of my team interviewed a hobbyist musican, who we defined to be a person who plays music in their spare time but doesn't make a living by performing. I interviewed a student at the University of Washington who sings classical opera as a side hobby, and my group members interviewed others hobbyists.</p><br/>
						<p>Synthesizing this data, we created two user personas to gain a better sense of the difficulties our primary stakeholders may have been facing. While creating these personas, we were able to note the needs of our users, which helped us create a list of all the design requirements of our project in an effort to address their desires.</p>
