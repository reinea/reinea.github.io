				<h3>SPRING 2017</h3>

					<p>With the everyday person's busy schedule, it can be difficult to coordinate group activities when you have to consider multiple schedules. It can also be challenging to begin an interest or activity that involves a group when you don't know where or with whom to start. CommonGround is our solution to that-- it enables people to create and join local group events on their own schedule while building a network within a common interest.</p><br/>
					
					<br/><br/>
					<h3>PROBLEM</h3>
					<p>Without having anyone to share their interests with, many people see no choice but to shelve their passions. Without any way to meet other people with whom they something in common, new transplants and the socially anxious can feel lonely. Existing solutions fall short because many of them are event-driven and not user-driven. They often involve large groups of people, and it can hinder the experience of a more intimate hobby hangout. </p>
					<br/><br/>
					<h3>OUR USERS</h3>
					<p>Since we identified two main stakeholder groups, we split up into two teams and
investigated our potential users and business owners separately. For our users, we created a survey which had them detail their habits and hang-ups regarding their hobbies. We focused the questions on how they organized themselves with other people in their hobby and the problems they had pursuing their interests. Each member of our group decided how to distribute the survey individually with some asking specific friends while others posted a link on their social media feeds for their friends/followers to answer. We received 11 responses.</p>
<br/>
<p>Looking closely at the data taken from the people who filled the surveys, it is interesting that most people preferred not to put much effort into looking for people that share the same interest, rather they wanted to go to places that they were already grouped there such as gyms, clubs, classes, bands and RSOs (Registered Student Organizations). 80% of people had hobbies and interests that they did with groups of people, but currently most of them are not using applications to find people who have the same interests except for Tinder. Most of them are willing to retain the same plan with the same group of people if they enjoy their company and get along with them. When asked what was the factor that prevented them from pursuing their current interest, most of them answered time, but some mentioned anxiety and fear of new interactions and a few people mentioned money and low finances.</p>
