				<h1>'CAKE POTATO' BLOG THEME</h1>
			</div>
			<img src="/PortfolioImages/CakePotatoProjectImages/cakepotatomain.png" alt="Cake Potato Theme" style= "width: 100%;">
			<p>I started blogging about my photos in the seventh grade, equipped with my point-and-shoot camera and Tumblr account. One by one, I'd post the unedited pictures on a pre-made free theme with an obscenely blue background with white trim along the borders. But in 2015, I decided to take lifestyle blogging a little more seriously and started my own Blogspot account. I tinkered around with the default plain Blogspot theme and slowly started learning some HTML, and by the beginning of 2016, I had my own theme to work with! It wouldn't be till the end of that same year that I'd decide to re-brand and cater more to my audience.</p>

				<h1>THE IDEA</h1>
			</div>
			<img src="/PortfolioImages/CakePotatoProjectImages/oldthemes.jpg" alt="Old Themes" style= "width: 100%;">
			<p>I started with Theme 1.0 when I first started, but it just wasn't personalized enough for me. I felt that a blog about my life had to reflect my interests and who I was as a person, so I started by making a logo and customizing my sidebar a little bit. After several months of fiddling with Blogspot's customizable HTML and CSS, I had some semblance of a theme. I made it up as I went on, so I was surprised that the results seemed decent and worked relatively well.</p>
			<p>Of course, there were a few bugs here and there. I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted in Cake Potato Theme 2.0, so I had messed around with too much of the code and created some errors in the design that were difficult to fix. I wanted to tidy up the look of the blog and make it more mature as I've learned to take photography and lifestyle a little more seriously. Thus, the planning for Cake Potato Theme 3.0 began!</p>

				<h1>PLANNING + IDEATING</h1>
			</div>
			<p>Surprisingly, the easier part of the re-design was coming up with ideas of how to improve the audience's experience on the blog. By this time, I had established what I wanted my blog to be, and I knew that I had a lot of bugs to fix. I liked the general format of my blog already, so I didn't want to change <i>too</i> much, especially knowing that my readers liked most of what they were seeing. Still, I wanted to implement some features that would grow my audience and engage them more with what they were seeing. Here are some key elements that I wanted to add or keep:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>'Read More' Links</li>
				<li>Photo Slider</li>
				<li>Link Opacity on Hover</li>
				<li>Suggested Posts</li>
				<li>Larger Photos</li>
				<li>A Serious Logo</li>
			</ul>

				<h1>BUILDING THE HEADER</h1>
			</div>
			<img src="/PortfolioImages/CakePotatoProjectImages/Header.jpg" alt="Cake Potato Header" style= "width: 100%;">
			<p><b>The first thing to fix was my logo.</b> I wanted it to look more serious because the bubbly font looked a little childish, and the ribbon was hastily created on MS Paint. I drew out my ideas for the new logo on an iPad, and settled for a paint smear background with script font that showed that I mean business, the same style that I now use for the home page of my personal site and the top left corner of this page. Then, I created a navigation below the header with the most prevalent topics on my blog. Unlike my old theme, these change color on hover so that the visitor knows whether the link is selected or not.</p>

			<img src="/Users/reineabubakar/Desktop/Cake Potato Project/newheader.jpg" alt="New Logo" style= "width: 60%;">	
			<p>To complete the header of my blog, I implemented a slider underneath the links to show my most recent posts. Having little experience with Javascript, I had to look for a slider online that would work with my blog. From this base, I was able to customize it with CSS to better suit my blog's appearance and needs.</p>

				<h1>CODING THE BODY</h1>
			</div>
			<img src="/PortfolioImages/CakePotatoProjectImages/body.jpg" alt="Cake Potato Theme Building" style= "width: 100%;">
			<p>Working on the body itself was the most difficult part of the project. I had to find a script to automatically show a preview of a post (including the first photo in the post), along with a 'Read More' button. I then had to customize the preview and the button, but thankfully Java has taught me how to underestand Javascript a little better. I made the larger photos, and replaced the post footer with social media icons.</p>
			<p>For the posts themselves, I incorporated a feature where it suggests other posts that have similar tags as the current post. So as the reader finishes a particular post, they find other posts on my blog that may be related to what they are interested in.</p>
			<p>On the side, I created a wider sidebar with <i>more</i> links and additional topics that they may be interested in, right next to box where my audience can subscribe to my blog. Above that, I added a contact button. By expanding the sidebar, the widgets had room to breath, giving Cake Potato the modern and more mature feeling that I was going for.</p>
			<p>Additionally, I added a footer as my old theme didn't have one. Staying true to being a photo blog, I decided to add an Instagram widget that displayed my recent posts in a row, along with credit for my icons, and a 'back to top' button for those who may have strayed down the page.</p>

				<h1>REFLECTION</h1>
			</div>
			<img src="/PortfolioImages/CakePotatoProjectImages/comparison.jpg" alt="Cake Potato Theme Comparison" style= "width: 100%;">
			<p>There is still so much I want to improve on this blog theme. Though most of the work is done, there are still specific pages that need improvement. I plan on making an Archives page that display old posts with thumbnails so that readers can more easily find a particular post they are looking for. I am also planning on creating a more visually appealing contact page that will let readers get in touch easily without having to open their personal email or have them know mine.</p>
			<p>But hopefully as time passes, and as my content and audience evolve, so does my theme to better suit our preferences. I hope that as I grow and change, so does my blog and its theme.</p>
