				<h1>MY WORK</h1>
				<p>I took my first computer science course in high school, where I learned the basics of Java. After discovering my interest in programming, I began experimenting with HTML/CSS on my personal blog and later on some Blogspot themes. It wasn't until college that I pieced together the puzzle and realized that I loved the technicalities of computer science and the design aspect of HTML. I decided to pursue Human Centered Design and Engineering as a result.</p>
				<p>Below are some personal and academic projects that I have undertaken in the past few years. Each one has a particular audience in mind, focused on how they will interact and respond to the project.</p>

					<h1>PLANT APP</h1>
					<h3>Interaction Design Concept, Fall 2016</h3>
					<p> As part of my HCDE 210 course, we studied interaction design through citizen science. I had to create an app that enabled everyday people to gather large amounts of data for scientists while reaping rewards and maintaining incentive. How do we design an app with the audience in mind?</p>

					<h1>'CAKE POTATO' THEME</h1>
					<h3>Blog Theme Design & Build, Winter 2016</h3>
					<p> In 2015, I decided to combine my love for writing and taking pictures in a photo blog called 'Cake Potato'. For the beginning of its third year since the launch, it needed a refresh in appearance, so I designed and built a theme that felt more personal and reflected the things I posted about. To cater to the audience I was attracting, I included some interactive links, a slider, and larger photos.</p>

					<h1>COMMONGROUND APP</h1>
					<h3>App Design & Prototype, Spring 2017</h3>
					<p>I took an course in informatics where we were assigned the task of
					designing a tool that would help people organize the data in their everyday 
					lives. My team prototyped an app that allowed users to organize
				    group activities in a way that connected them with new people and enabled
				    them to discover new interests.

					<h1>'SISTERS BAKING' WEBSITE</h1>
					<h3>Website Design & Build, Spring 2017</h3>
					<p>The Sisters Baking Company is an Edmonds-based granola business
					that was looking for a fresh, minimal look for their site. They wanted an
					online image that was as simple as their ingredients. Together we created
					a photo-friendly website that was easier to navigate and catered
					more towards their targeted consumers.</p>

					<h1>HCDE 210 BLOG</h1>
					<h3>Project Processes, Fall 2016</h3>
					<p>In Autumn 2016, I took an introduction to HCDE course that opened my eyes to the complexities of design and engineering. Each week, we focused on a specific aspect of Human Centered Design and Engineering, and we talked about our projects on a blog. From prototyping to data visualizations, it's all here.</p>
