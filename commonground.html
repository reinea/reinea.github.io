"width: 100%;">   <p>People often lead busy lives, and it can be difficult to arrange group activities when you have to 
coordinate and consider multiple schedules. It can also be challenging to begin an interest or activity that involves a group when 
you don't know where to start. CommonGround enables people to create and join group events in their area, allowing the users to 
participate in group activities on their own schedule, while building a network within the interest.</p>   <li><a title="See the Prototype" href="https://invis.io/6BBY80SSY">SEE THE PROTOTYPE</a></li>  </div>        <div class="post">   <div class="posttitle">    <h1>USERS IN MIND</h1>   </div>    <p >For this project, my group determined which types of people are most likely to encounter these 
problems, as well as which groups of people may be affected by this obstacle. We evaluated the primary stakeholders and created user 
personas based on these possible app users.Then based on these personas, we surveyed real people who closely resembled these figures, 
looking for what they wanted in a group-activity app.</p>    <img src="/PortfolioImages/CommonGround/commongroundpersonas.jpg" alt="Personas" style= "width: 100%;

  <div class="post">   <div class="posttitle">    <h1>DESIGN + CHALLENGES</h1>   </div>    <p >Using the survey responses to gauge what our targeted audience needed in the app, my team began 
designing the interfaces, focusing on the activity-based options and social features. We built the draft on LucidChart and created a 
high-fidelity protoype through InVision.</p>    <img src="/PortfolioImages/CommonGround/commongrounddraft.jpg" alt="App Draft" style= "width: 100%; 
height: auto;">    <img src="/PortfolioImages/CommonGround/commongroundfinal.jpg" alt="App Final" style= "width: 100%; 
height: auto;">    <p >The distinguishing elements that separates this app from competitors like 'MeetUp' is its primary 
focus on one-time activities with people with the same interest. But with this concept, we had to find a way to engage our users and 
encourage continued use of our app. As a solution, we implemented a points-based rewards system that users could use to redeem retail 
vouchers and other coupons. Also, the app will continue to suggest other interests based on their history and profile, as well as 
encourage the formation of social circles to maintain connections between people who have attended activities together.  </p>       </div>  </div> <!-- Closes General Posts -->    <footer>  <div class="contactbuttons"> <!-- Social Media buttons at the footer -->      <ul>    <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/reinea">    <img alt="github" src="http://i64.tinypic.com/2a6v6o2.png" /></a>       <a title="Email" href="mailto:reinekhadija@gmail.com">    <img alt="email" src="http://i67.tinypic.com/yz5gh.png" /></a>       <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/potatoesdream">    <img alt="twitter" src="http://i63.tinypic.com/1547vqo.png" /></a>
