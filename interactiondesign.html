				<h1>INTERACTION DESIGN</h1>
			</div>
			<img src="/images/PortfolioImages/InteractionDesign/interactiondesign.jpg" alt="Interaction Design Plant App" style= "width: 100%;">
			<p>One of the most interesting topics we learned in my HCDE 210 course was <b>interaction design</b>. This brief introduction to app design showed me the smallest glimpse of the complexities of engineering and design. There were so many things to consider: the interface, user interactions, the purpose of the app, and even the process of putting this all together. I found myself asking: what makes a good app?</p>

				<h1>THE CONCEPT</h1>
			</div>
			<p>We were given a target audience to create an app for, along with a particular task that this app was to accomplish. The general theme was citizen science, so I had to create an app that would help scientists in King County keep track of plant locations. It would be the app user's job to collect the data and send it through their phones. The challenge was to design the app in a way that would engage the user while simultaneously effectively compiling data for experts.</p>
			<p>First, I needed to know the purpose of my app. It needed to be simple enough to attract a user of any age, it had to be detailed enough to collect significant complete data for scientists, and it had to be engaging enough to maintain its audience.</p>

				<h1>PROTOTYPING</h1>
			</div>
				<img src="/images/PortfolioImages/InteractionDesign/paper prototype.jpg" alt="Concept + Planning" style= "width: 100%; height: auto;">
				<p>We had to create a low-fidelity prototype on paper, so I drew each page on a small sheet of paper. I made sure to create an easy-to-use interface with lots of images, and a variety of options people could use to enter information. In return for providing information, users gain points for every plant they log, which could be redeemed for gift cards to popular retailers.</p>
				<p>Using the paper-prototyping app called POP, I uploaded these images to allow a more interactive prototype with buttons that link to other pages. On Photoshop, I then created a rough sketch of what it would look like as an actual app (using the same design of the paper plan) and used POP again to create a prototype.</p>
